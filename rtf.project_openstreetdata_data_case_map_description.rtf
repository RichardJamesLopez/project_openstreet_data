\f0\fs24 \cf0 The map extract that I chose from Mapzen was of the Bozeman, MT area in the United States. It is a small city in the a very sparsely populated state and I thought it would be unique. Much to my chagrin, my initial extract of the metropolitan area didn\'92t yield enough data for the basic size requirements. As a result, I extracted more data by expanding my map area to include the metropolitan area as well as the surrounding peri-urban localities. }
